1)Learn advanced concepts related to Abstraction and Encapsulation

Abstraction and encapsulation are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that help manage complexity and improve code organization. Abstraction focuses on presenting only the essential features of an object, hiding unnecessary details, while encapsulation bundles related data and methods into a single unit, controlling access to protect internal state. These principles are essential for creating modular, maintainable, and secure software. 

• Definition: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing on relevant features and ignoring non-essential details. It provides a high-level view of an object or system, allowing developers to work at a higher level without getting bogged down in implementation details.
  
• Example: Imagine a car. An abstract view of a car might include features like starting, stopping, accelerating, and steering, but not the intricate details of the engine, wiring, or brakes. 
  
• Benefits: 
	• Simplified Design: Makes code easier to understand and work with by hiding complexity.  
	• Flexibility: Allows for changes in implementation without impacting how users interact with the system.   
	• Code Reusability: Enables the creation of general-purpose classes and interfaces that can be reused in different contexts.  

Encapsulation:  

• Definition: Encapsulation bundles data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, an object, and controls access to the data. It hides the internal implementation details of an object, providing a protected layer. 
• Example: In a Person class, the social security number might be encapsulated as a private member, making it inaccessible from outside the class. Access is controlled through public methods (getters and setters).  
• Benefits: 
	• Data Security: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.  
	• Controlled Access: Allows controlled interaction with an object's internal state.   
	• Modularity: Changes to the implementation details of an object do not affect the way other parts of the code interact with it.  
	• Maintainability: Makes it easier to modify and extend code without breaking existing functionality.   

How Abstraction and Encapsulation Work Together: 

• Abstraction defines the "what" (the interface or public view of an object), while encapsulation handles the "how" (the internal implementation details). 
• By using both concepts together, developers can create systems that are both flexible and secure. 
• Abstraction allows for clear and simplified interfaces, while encapsulation ensures that the internal workings of those interfaces are hidden and protected. 
Advanced Concepts:  

• Interface Abstraction: Interfaces define a contract for how classes should interact with each other, allowing for loose coupling and flexibility.   
• Abstract Classes: Abstract classes provide a partial implementation and can't be instantiated directly, but they can be extended by concrete classes. 
• Data Encapsulation in Databases: Databases use abstraction and encapsulation to hide complex data storage mechanisms and provide a simplified interface for querying and manipulating data.
