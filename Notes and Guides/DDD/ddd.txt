Domain driven development- 
It is an approach in Software development that centers on modelling the real-world domain of a problem statement and building the software that reflects it.


In DDD the domain model becomes the backbone of the system. The code and design are driven by this model using ubiquitous language.

Design Types in DDD-
1. Entity : Any model which has id, which is mutable
2. Value Object : Any model which does not need unique id which is immutable
3. Aggregate : An entity made up of other entities
4. Repository : An abstraction layer on top of DB
5. Service : Is aa class, where teh domain 
	a.doain
	b.
